The ALGT package can be imported and contains the standard library. It contains:

- ALGT.Builtins: all builtin bnf-forms and functions (such as plus, parse, ...)
- ALGT.Native: contains all language definitions of the native language (in which 'these modules' are written) and which the binary loads natively
