Tools: In this folder you'll find some of the pieces that the modules here need, such as...
	- ExceptionInfo (and Failable): the monad handling failure
	- Checkable: a typeclass representing stuff that can be validated
	- Grouper: a fancy implementation of an ordered dictionary
	- LocationInfo: data structures keeping track of what is notated where
